## Crab Job Submission

please change the [line](https://github.com/LPCPandaPhysics/PandaProd/blob/branch-80X/Producer/cfg/submitCrab.py#L45) in submitCrab.py to point to your personal EOS area (Soon LPCPhysics EOS will exist for common storage)
```
     #setup
     cd PandaProd/Producer/cfg/
     source setupCrab.sh
     python submitCrab.py
```
## Hints: User experience column
1. For running on privately produced files in eos space (cmslpc), ensure the directory structure strictly adhere to the follow:
   ```  
     root://cmseos.fnal.gov//store/<user or group>/<username or groupname>/<folder1>/<folder2>/<rootfiles>
   ```
  ```<folder1>``` = First level folder is allowed as long as you don't get cheesy with the naming.
  ```<folder2>``` = strictly imitate the name of the dataset
  ```<folder3>``` = root files 
     
  If not, you will end up debugging whole day with meaningless error message.
